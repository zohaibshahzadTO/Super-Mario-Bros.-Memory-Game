# Super Mario Bros. Memory Game

The premise of the game is to have a grid of 24 face-down cards. The card faces consist of pairs of matches. Clicking on cards will flip them over, revealing the value. When two are chosen, if it’s a match, both cards will disappear. If it’s not, the cards will flip back over to face-down. The game should be different every time the game is refreshed.

# Planning

Before writing any code, we need to get an idea of the actual steps to take to go from nothing to finished product. Building this whole game at once might seem a bit overwhelming, but if you break it into small tasks, each task will seem achievable until it’s done.

<li>Display 12 cards.</li>
<li>Duplicate the cards to have 2 sets of 12.</li>
<li>Randomize the display of cards.</li>
<li>Add selected style for selected cards.</li>
<li>Determine if two selected cards are a match and hide them.</li>
<li>Only allow two cards to be selected at a time.</li>
<li>Reset guess count after 2.</li>
<li>Add delay to selections.</li>
<li>Show back of card initially and flip on select</li>
<li>Finished game!</li>
